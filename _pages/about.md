I'm Zaid, a data analyst and market researcher based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My path here wasn't straightforward - financial constraints after my Actuarial Science diploma pushed me into the workforce instead of further education. At InsightzSurvey, 5 years later, I've climbed from newcomer to leading the scripting team, mastering the art of learning on the job.

Now, I'm setting my sights on data science. I've been a part of as well as witnessed the power of transforming raw data into actionable insights, and I'm eager to be at the forefront of this field. 

Outside of work, I'm an avid film enthusiast and local league Basketball player. Check out my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/sanisideup/) to see what I'm watching! :)
